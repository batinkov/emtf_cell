ver-01-12 : moved getDataWidth to the baseclass GeneralHardwareAddress
ver-01-14 : before the change of the GeneralHardwareAddress which was moved
            now contains a common interface for PCI and VME. (This is due

            file structure.
ver-02-00 : version with working VME64xCrate debugged with hardware.
            New SBSBusAdapter_test corrects some features. 
ver-02-01 : 
ver-02-02 : release on www with VME64x. Byte swapping in SBSBusAdapter. Example for XDAQ.
            new libHALUtilities.so. XDAQSupport lib with database access. New XML file 
            format, and scripts to convert. Offsets are checked not to go out of limits
            of address table.
ver-02-03 : Makefile changes : more consistent target names, new 1.3 Makefiles for V1_3 XDAQ.
            byte-swapping in PCIBusAdapter enabled. Lot's of small fixes for VME64x.

XercesMigration-00 : branch to do xerces migration.

ver-02-05 : intermediate tag for pre-xerces-2-3 development. 
ver-02-06 : included ascii vme64x reader. some changes in configuration scripts etc. 
            Try to make this the last release for the old version of xdaq/xerces.
            After this the xerces-2-3 branch will be merged into the main branch. 
            This tag will go to the www as last version before xdaq 2.0.
ver-02-07 : introduced blocking of the SBS driver for every access
            in utilties there is a programs to dump configuration space.
	    introduced an example for debugging VME64x modules
            default compiler is gcc-alt-3.2.3
ver-03-00-test : first version with xerces 2.3, couts go to os_, 
                 migration to new xdaq ver2 (intro of log4cplus)
                 VME64x: only configure hardware which is not yet configured
ver-03-01-test : Makefile, configure cleanup, 
	         small bugfix in DummyBusAdapters
		 cleanup of ASCIIPCIConverter.pl script and minor mods of other tools.
ver-03-02-test : change of output of VMEAddressTable.print: no rw flag anymore
                 update of tools converter scripts
ver-03-03 : some very preliminary version of CAEN busAddapter (not official yet, not
            supported by configure script). PCIDevice has new api: Now possible to
            find a device by bus, "slot", functionId.
ver-03-04: version which went into DAQKit-01. Includes support for CAEN BusAdpater.
	   SBS BusAdapter is semaphore protected. Tools to handle the semaphore.
	   SBS driver v2p3p0, configure changes, ASCII file WINDOOF safe, 
           resetBbus implemented for SBS, New constructor for PCIi386BusAdapter
ver-03-05-test: bugfix for addressboundary determination in case of vme64x.
           Bugfix in interface of VME64xDummyBusAdapter.
ver-03-05-test-01: Bugfix in StopWatch (influencing performance only). 
           New class VMEAddressTableDynamicReader to dynamically create 
	   VME address tables (request from HCAL).
ver-03-05-test-02: SBSBusadapter implements interrupt support and 
           HAL_NO_INCREMENT in Block transfers. Changes in VME64x plug and
           play configuration: User becomes owner of VMEDevices. VMEDevices
	   are now always created when getVMEDevice is called. Only 
	   Not enabled devices are configured. Enabled devices are read out
	   and treated like static VMEDevices.
ver03-05-test-04: eliminate VME64ASCIIAddresstableReader since now the 
           VMEAddressTableASCII reader can distinguish between VME and VME64.
           CopyCOnstgructor for AddressTable, AddressTableItem for making
           deep copies since the addresstable container gives back a reference to the
           addresstable which needs a copyconstructo to assign to 
           AddressTable instance variables.
ver-03-05  Version for the DAQKit-02-00. Changed default compiler to system
           compiler since this version is for SLC linux. (works also with 7.3.x)

           (usb and optical)
ver-03-07  namespace HAL introduced
           Exceptions are now derived from the XDAQ xcept package.
           CAENLinuxBusAdapter now handles usb version and optical version of
           bridge. Support of byte swapping for CAEN busadapter.
ver-03-08  simpler config script. Tighter embedding into XDAQ.
ver-03-09  small mod in the Makefile in order to have a default target
ver-03-10-test-01 implemented chaining for caen busadapters, bugfix in doc makefile
ver-03-10-test-02 implemented fifo mode for caen busadapters.
ver-03-10 Fifomode and chaining in the caen busadapter.
ver-03-11 Introduced VME64xDevice to access UserCR UserCSR and CRAM regions
          in VME64x Modules. The VME64xCrate returnes VME64xDevices or 
          VMEDevices for standard VME modules.
ver-03-12 VME4xDevice now can also read standard VME64x items. It understands
          these without that they need to be defined in user address table.
ver-03-13-test-01 Bugfix in VMEAddresstableASCIIReader: did not consider width for 
          configuration space items.
ver-03-13 Bugfix: virtual desctructor for VMEBusAdapterInterface and PCIBusAdapterInterface.
          Corrections of version string in xdaq examples. Error message clariefied.

                this tag is on branch "namespace_rework".
ver-03-14-test4 bugfix: inserted missing std::

namespace_rework: a branch which branched off from ver-03-14-test-2 to implement namespace 
          cleanup and 64bit compatibility.

3.18      CAENVMELinuxBusadapter can now be called from the same process several times.
          configure script is compatible with rpm installation of CAEN driver.
3.19      small bugfix in the HardwareDevice concerning exception throwing
V4_0_0-0  version in a new unified compile and release scheme. Generation of
          binary and development RPMs.
