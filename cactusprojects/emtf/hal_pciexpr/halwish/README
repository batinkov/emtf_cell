This is halwish version 0.1.

This is an extension to the tcl/tk interpreter 'wish' to easily use
the HAL library. It works for VME and PCI cards.

You need four files:

halAppInt.cc
Card.h
Card.cc
PCICard.cc
PCICard.h
Makefile

You need Tk 8.3, and an installed and working HAL version, with the
appropriate bus adapter, implying a PCI-VME interface. 

Usage: In the makefile select the correct PLATFORM := BT1003 or
VXILINUX and set up the correct directories. Type 'make' and you
should get an executable called halwish. This can be used as exactly
wish, with the addition of one command:

vmecard <name> <base address> <address map>

This creates a new command <name> that communicates to the VME card at
base address <base address> using the address map in <address map>.

pcicard <name> <vendor> <device> <index> <address map>

This creates a new command <name> that communicates to the PCI card at
base address <base address> using the address map in <address map>.

With one argument it returns the value read from the given address,
with two arguments it writes the value of the second argument to the
address given in the first argument and returns the empty string:

<name> <address item>
<name> <address item> <value>

TTTThe files TTCvi.tk and TTCviAddressMap.dat provide an example using
the TTCvi card. To try it, set the base address of your TTCvi card in 
TTCvi.tk, and type

./halwish TTCvi.tk
