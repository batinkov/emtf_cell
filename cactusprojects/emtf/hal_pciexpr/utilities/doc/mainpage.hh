*   \section Introduction
*            The utility  library contains  classes which are  used in 
*            the examples  and the classtesters of the  HAL, but which 
*            are not necessary  to compile or use the HAL. Users might 
*            find some  of the classes  usesful in their  own programs 
*            and therefore the library is documented here.
