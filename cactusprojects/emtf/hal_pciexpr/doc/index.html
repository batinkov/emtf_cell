<H1>HAL (Hardware Access Library)</H1>
<H3>A library developed for the CMS data aquisition system at CERN</H3>
<H3>Version 4_0_0-1 10th-April-2007</H3>

</center>
A high level interface which allows for user friendly 
hardware access to VME or PCI modules. 
<p>
The library contains a software layer between the user program and the 
driver software to access hardware. A class called "BusAdapter" implements
the interface to the various hardware drivers. Several BusAdapters are 
contained in the distribution. It is easy for the user to extend this collection
by writing his own BusAdapter.
<p>
The HAL library currently supports VME and PCI hardware accesses.
For the current list of supported BusAdapters please refer to the online 
<A HREF="http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~cschwick/software/documentation/HAL/index.html">HAL homepage</A>.
</p>
<p> 
If you use XML AddressTables you need the schema
against which your address table will be checked. It is contained in the root
directory of the distribution (HardwareAddressTable-ver-2-0.xsd) or it is available at
<a href="http://xdaq.web.cern.ch/xdaq/xsd/HardwareAddressTable-ver-2-0.xsd">
http://xdaq.web.cern.ch/xdaq/xsd/HardwareAddressTable-ver-2-0.xsd</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed you use the HAL library in the context of the XDAQ online environment
of CMS. There are two dependencies on libraries in the TriDAS directory tree:
<ul><li>
The xerces package is needed to support XML Addresstables. It should be installed
in $XDAQ_ROOT/daq/extern.</li>
<li>The exceptions thrown by the HAL are derived from the baseclass in the 
XDAQ xcept package. 
</li>
</ul>
If for some reason the HAL must be installed without the XDAQ environment, these
two libraries can be installed independently and the Makefile.in can be edited in
order set variables which point to the location of the two needed libraries.

<H2> Documentation </H2>
<UL>
  <LI>The <B>Users Guide</B>
    contains a complete description of the library including architecture,
    functionality, installation guide, user-instructions and instructions
    how to extend the library (for example to custom hardware drivers).
    It is available <A HREF="manual/HALUsersGuide.pdf">in pdf format</B></A>.
  </LI>  
  <LI>
    The <A HREF="generic/html/index.html"><B>API documentation</B></A> 
    of the current version (see below) of the HAL library can be browsed 
    here. It is the most important 
    document for user's prgramming with HAL. The 
    <A HREF="busAdapter/html/index.html"><B>API of the BusAdapters</B></A> 
    can be found here. (In the API documentation there are cross links).
    A small library of useful utilities which you can use is documented :
    <A HREF="utilities/html/index.html"><B>API of the Utilities library</B></A> 
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <B>Examples</B> The HAL contains a series of examples where the usage of the
    various components is demonstrated. Among these a small application to 
    measure the overhead due to the HAL library for a single hardware access
    is included. Also a complete XDAQ application using the HAL library is 
    included.
