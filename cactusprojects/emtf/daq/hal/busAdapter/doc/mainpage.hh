*            
*            This  is  the  API  documentation  of  the  BusAdapters 
*            included  in the Hardware  Access Library  documentation.  
*            For an  introduction read the manual which  has come with 
*            this distribution. 
*            
*            The  drivers for  the  BusAdapters are  not contained  in 
*            this  distribution. The  following list  tells  you where 
*            you can find them:
*                        
*            @li The drivers for the CAENLinuxBusAdapter 
*            is available in the xdaq framework.
*            http://xdaq.web.cern.ch and to download the software
*            http://xdaq.web.cern.ch/xdaq/repo 
*            The drivers of CAEN are packaged so that they install
*            easily in the xdaq environmen. System V startup scripts
*            handle the loading of the drivers.
*            The BusAdapter contained in this version of the HAL handles
*            the USB and optical link version of the CAEN adapters.
